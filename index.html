      </h2>
      <p>
        I went to school in Tacoma and attended high school at the Tacoma School of the Arts. I graduated in 2013, and though I tried college a couple of times, I ultimately found it wasn't for me

        Work
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have worked in a small variety of jobs, from camp counselor to pizza maker, and until quarantine I worked at Federal Way Custom Jewelers as an operations assistant, handling anything from data entry to tech support and also spent a decent amount of time on the sales floor when required.

      <h2>
        Goals
      </h2>
      <p>
        Right now my main goals in life are to finish Codefellows and walk away with the understanding and skills of development to begin a career in the software development field. After that I would love to travel, as I have always had a desire to but have not had much opportunity due to never having enough money and not having a job with enough flexibility. My first place to visit would probably be Ireland.
